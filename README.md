# Coding without Coding: Models, No Code, AI

Artificial Intelligence is transforming the way we develop software. Vibecoding, for example, promises non-programmers the ability to create applications without ever writing a single line of code. But is it really that simple? What about the multiple qualities of the code that is produced? What kinds of software can realistically be vibecoded? And are there complementary, and safer, approaches worth considering?

This course examines three major “coding without coding” paradigms:

* Model-Driven Engineering, where reliable code generators are carefully designed by humans
* No-Code/Low-Code Engineering, where reliable platforms interpret models
* AI-Driven Engineering, where code is generated through sequences of sophisticated prompts

Each paradigm has distinct characteristics and serves different stakeholders. The course highlights these differences and shows how they can be combined, depending on the context and the task at hand.
